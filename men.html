        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>We are <strong>Mentor Men Leadership Forum,</strong> a platform which began by an heavenly and divinely orchestrated Vision   and Hunger the lord laid upon our Pastor and Convener in the name of Pastor Gentle C Nwobi(Eagle).</p>
        <p>We don't discriminate between denominations, because we believe by the provision of the Scriptures, that being a Catholic, an Anglican, a Presbetarian, or even Penticostal dosen't automatically <strong>Migrate</strong> you from the family of the Devil, to that of Christ, the <strong>Migration</strong> is attained/made possible by the provision of Salvation; Which was  accesible to all when Jesus Christ the first Begotten of the father which was and is God, came down from his highly exalted throne, with the sole purpose of <strong>reconciling</strong> us back to Him and to his Father.
